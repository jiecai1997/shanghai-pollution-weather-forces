"0","# as shown in the exploratory data analysis, we should do some transformations as many linear regression assumptions are violated"
"0","# have to add 0.01 to transformed x-variables since we cannot log (0)"
"0","# x-variables to transform (non-linearity): log(Iws+0.01), log(precipitation+0.01), log(Iprec+0.01)"
"0","# y-varable to transform (non-constant variance): log(PM_US.Post)"
"0","# try with these transformations"
