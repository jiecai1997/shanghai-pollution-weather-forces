"0","# multicollinearity (>0.8) between: pressure & dew point, pressure & temperature, dew point & temperature"
"0","# multicollinear variables: pressure, dew point, temperature"
"0","# fortunately, these variables are not messing up the standard errors, so we don't have to remove them"
"0","# summary: after looking at multi-collinearity values bewteen variables, we can consider removing: pressure, dew point. "
"0","# next step: We will see which multicollinearity variables we can remove by manually doing some f-tests."
